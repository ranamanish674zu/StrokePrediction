# Stroke Prediction: A Data-Driven Approach

Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, making early prediction and prevention crucial. Leveraging machine learning, we can analyze key health indicators and lifestyle factors to assess the risk of stroke. This project utilizes a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, including variables such as age, hypertension, heart disease, and lifestyle habits, to build a predictive model. By accurately identifying individuals at high risk, we aim to contribute to public health awareness and preventive healthcare efforts.

## Steps for Predicting Stroke Risk

1. **Import Libraries**
   - Load necessary Python libraries for data manipulation, machine learning, and evaluation.

2. **Load the Data**
   - Read the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for analysis and preprocessing.

3. **Handle Missing Values**
   - Identify and fill or remove any missing values in the dataset to ensure data integrity.

4. **Encode Categorical Variables**
   - Convert categorical features into numerical values using techniques like One-Hot Encoding to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms.

5. **Split the Data into Features and Target**
   - Separate the dataset into independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target) for model training.

6. **Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets**
   - Divide the data into training and testing subsets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

7. **Feature Scaling**
   - Standardize the feature values to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one to improve the model's performance.

8. **Train the Model**
   - Use a machine learning algorithm, such as Random Forest, to train a predictive model on the training data.

9. **Make Predictions**
   - Apply the trained model to the test data to
